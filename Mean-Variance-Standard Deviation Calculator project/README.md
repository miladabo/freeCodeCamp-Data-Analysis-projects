# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is my first project for the **Data Analysis with Python** certification from freeCodeCamp.

## Project Overview
In this project, I created a function named `calculate()` in `mean_var_std.py` that uses NumPy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3
* NumPy

## Learning Outcomes
* Manipulating Python lists and converting them into NumPy arrays.
* Using the `.reshape()` method to create matrices.
* Understanding and implementing calculations across different axes (Axis 0, Axis 1, and Flattened).
* Error handling using `raise ValueError` for input validation.

## How to Run
To run the project and see the test results, execute:
```bash
python main.py
